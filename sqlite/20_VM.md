Every SQL database engine works in roughly the same way: It first translates the input SQL text into a "prepared statement". Then it "executes" the prepared statement to generate a result.

A prepared statement is an object that represents the steps needed to accomplish the input SQL. Or, to think of it in another way, the prepared statement is the SQL statement translated into a form that is more easily understood by the computer.

In SQLite, a prepared statement is an instance of the sqlite3_stmt object. In other systems, the prepared statement is usually an internal data structure that is not directly visible to the application programmer. Developers of other SQL database engines do not necessarily call these objects "prepared statements". But such objects exists, whatever they might be called. This paper will use the term "prepared statement".

There are countless ways of implementing a prepared statement. This paper will look at the two most common methods:

    Bytecode → The input SQL is translated into a virtual machine language that is then run by a virtual machine interpreter. This is the technique used by SQLite.

    Tree-Of-Objects → The input SQL is translated in a tree of objects that represent the processing to be done. The SQL is executed by walking this tree. This is the technique used by MySQL and PostgreSQL.
