# IO
* it is action, not value, not function
* it is a special type of value

readFile :: FilePath -> IO String

it returns a IO thing, which means you have to use readFile function in a `do` block, meaning you can't write a function of type IO String -> String to get the value out of the output from readFile.

Example:
```haskell
main = do
  s <- readFile "somefile"
  let len = length s
  putStrLn (show len)
```

Here, we don't write `len <- length s` because length is a normal function, not an IO stuff.

# State Monad
We define `StateT` as a function type synonym, which stands for a piece of knowledge about transforming states.

`type StateT st a = st -> (st, a)`

We also define `return` and `bind` functions as:
```haskell
return :: a -> StateT st a
return a = \stateX -> (stateX, a)

bind :: StateT st a -> (a -> StateT st b) -> StateT st b
bind know1 know2 = \st0 ->
  let (st1, a) = know1 st0
      know3    = know2 a
  in know3 st1
```
