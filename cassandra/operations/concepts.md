Bootstraping
* Adding new nodes is called “bootstrapping”. The num_tokens parameter will define the amount of virtual nodes (tokens) the joining node will be assigned during bootstrap. The tokens define the sections of the ring (token ranges) the node will become responsible for.
* This is for a new node to join
* Once a node is in a ring/cluster, it should remain the same IP address, if you want to change, refer to change-ip-of-a-node.md
